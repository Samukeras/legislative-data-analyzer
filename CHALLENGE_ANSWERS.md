# Challenge Questions & Answers

## Time Complexity Analysis

The solution performs multiple passes through the data for different purposes:

1. **Data Structure Choice**: Uses Maps for O(1) lookups of legislators, bills, and votes
2. **Data Processing**:
    - Schema validation: O(n) for validating each dataset;
    - Vote analysis: O(n) for processing vote results for legislators;
    - Bill analysis: O(n) for processing vote results for bills.
3. **Overall Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of vote results
    - Creating lookup maps: O(m) where m is number of legislators/bills;
    - Processing vote results: O(n) with O(1) lookups (would be O(n*m) without Maps);
    - Generating output: O(m).

Trade-offs made:
- Memory usage increased to store lookup maps, but this was a conscious decision to achieve O(1) access time;
- Prioritized read performance over write performance;
- Used simple data structures for better maintainability.

## Future Column Adaptability

The code is designed to be easily extensible for new columns through multiple layers:

1. **Dynamic Processing**: Both the CSV Parser and UI components are generated based on the object structure, automatically handling new columns without changes;
2. **Schema Validation**: The Schema class provides a centralized and organized way to update data validation rules, making it straightforward to add new field requirements.

Examples of adding new columns:

1. Adding "Voted On Date" to votes:
```javascript
// Add to votes.csv schema validation
static validateVotesData(votes) {
    votes.forEach(vote => {
        if (!vote.id || !vote.bill_id || !vote.voted_on_date) {
            throw new Error(`Invalid vote data`);
        }
    });
}
```

2. Adding "Co-Sponsors" to bills:
```javascript
// Add to bills.csv schema validation
static validateBillsData(bills) {
    bills.forEach(bill => {
        if (!bill.id || !bill.title || !bill.sponsor_id) {
            throw new Error(`Invalid bill data`);
        }
        // Optional co-sponsors validation
        if (bill.co_sponsors && !Array.isArray(bill.co_sponsors)) {
            throw new Error(`Co-sponsors must be an array`);
        }
    });
}
```

## Handling Specific Lists

The current solution is well-prepared to handle specific lists of legislators or bills thanks to its modular design:

1. The Schema class already defines and validates our data structures, making it easy to ensure the input lists follow the same format;
2. The CSV Parser handles both parsing and stringifying operations, so it can generate the required CSV output regardless of the input source;
3. The core analysis logic would remain unchanged since it already works with standard JavaScript objects.

This design means we'd only need to feed the provided lists into our existing pipeline, and the rest of the system would work as is.
